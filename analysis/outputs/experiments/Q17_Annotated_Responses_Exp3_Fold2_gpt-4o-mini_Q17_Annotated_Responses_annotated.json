As we got into second year, things have gone worse, mainly due to one of my CS courses that I am currently taking (will add more on this in the next question). If it was not for that specific course I think I would have been much happier, but this course has been really making me rethink my decision of taking CS at UTM in the first place. If we are to talk about the content, the content is not too difficult for me to handle, but the coordination of the course is just ridiculous.",
